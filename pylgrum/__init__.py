"""PyLGRum: Python Learning Gin Rummy

PyLGRum is an implementation of the card game Gin Rummy in Python.

For more details about the game history and rules, see:
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gin_rummy

Classes:

 Card: One card, with suit, rank (i.e. "queen", 2), and point value.
 Stack: A mutable stack of cards, with shuffle and search methods.
 Deck: 52 cards, one of each suit+rank. (Derived from Stack)
 Hand: The cards assigned to each player. (Derived from Stack)
 Rank: Enum of the face markings of cards (numbers + royalty).
 Suit: Enum of the card suits.

Exceptions:
 CardNotFoundError: raised on failed attempt to find or reference a card
                    in a Stack.

Note: this package uses PEP-484 style type annotations, and thus needs
python >=3.5
